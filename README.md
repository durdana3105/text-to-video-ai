# Text to Video AI

A web-based Text-to-Video AI application that converts natural language prompts into short videos using pretrained diffusion models.

## Features
- Text-to-video generation using AI
- FastAPI backend
- Simple web-based interface
- Cloud deployment ready

## Tech Stack
- Python
- FastAPI
- Hugging Face Diffusers
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Deployment
This project is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces using GPU for inference.

## Model Inference
This project uses the Hugging Face Inference API to perform text-to-video generation. 
The model runs on Hugging Face's hosted infrastructure, removing the need for local GPU resources 
while maintaining real-world AI integration.
